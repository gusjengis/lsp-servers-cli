# LSP Servers
This is a simple CLI utility. 

Given a directory, it returns a list of relevant language servers. Relevant meaning that they support file types that were found in the directory.

If given the -i flag, only installed language servers will be returned.

The purpose of this is just to check which servers need to be spun up when creating an LSP client that operates on a specific directory.

I'm creating this for personal use in [this](https://github.com/gusjengis/mermaid-class-diagrams) project that generates mermaid diagrams of codebases. If anyone else finds this useful and wants to improve it I would welcome PRs.
